Adaptive polling state machine.

States and intervals:
  PARKED_SLEEP   5 min   — no activity for 30+ min (car sleeping)
  PARKED_ACTIVE  60s     — normal parked, nothing unusual
  PARKED_ALERT   15s     — something changed (door/lock/temp): drive imminent
  DRIVING        10s     — speed > 0 or gear D
  CHARGING       60s     — plugged in
  OFFLINE        parked  — cloud unreachable; keeps the parked cadence (re-login rate-limited 60s)

Transitions (all independent of HA and phone):
  UNKNOWN/OFFLINE     → PARKED_ACTIVE  first successful poll
  PARKED_SLEEP        → PARKED_ACTIVE  fingerprint changes (any signal)
  PARKED_ACTIVE       → PARKED_ALERT   fingerprint changes
  PARKED_ACTIVE       → PARKED_SLEEP   no change for SLEEP_AFTER_S (30 min)
  PARKED_ALERT        → DRIVING        speed > 0 or gear D
  PARKED_ALERT        → PARKED_ACTIVE  no drive within ALERT_EXPIRES_S (5 min)
  DRIVING             → PARKED_ACTIVE  gear P held ~1 min (6 × 10s), OR cable plugged (trip ends now)
  ANY_PARKED          → CHARGING       charging_status > 0  (REAL current / 1149==2; NOT the cable alone)
  CHARGING            → PARKED_ACTIVE  cable unplugged (1149→0) and no current — a current dip alone won't close
  ANY                 → OFFLINE        3 consecutive API errors
