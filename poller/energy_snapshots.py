"""Phase-1 silent collector for the car's official energy counters (design agreed 2026-07-02).

Once a day, read the lifetime counters from the cloud (`totalEnergy` = ALL consumption incl.
parked/standby, integer kWh; `totalmileage` at 0.1-mile resolution) plus the official getEC
driving split over the window since the previous snapshot, and append one raw row to
`energy_counter_snapshots`. No UI consumes this yet — the ledger just accrues.

Why counter sampling: Δ between any two rows carries at most ±1 kWh of quantization error at the
window edges, REGARDLESS of the span (we subtract two meter readings, we never sum rounded
deltas) — noisy on a single day, solid on weeks/months. The getEC window uses the SAME bounds as
the Δ (previous row's taken_at → this row's), so `Δ − getEC = parked/standby share` holds by
construction even if a skipped day widens the window.

Ledger rules: store readings AS SERVED, never correct in place — counter resets/decreases and
cloud gaps are the reader's job (total_increasing-style). A getEC miss is recoverable later
(getEC is retro-queryable); a lost counter reading is not, so the row is written even when getEC
misses.
