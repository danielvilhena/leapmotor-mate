"""Retroactive scan for charges missed while the car was asleep — GitHub #35.

Recovers home charges that happened before live reconstruction existed (or while the
poller was down): a SoC that rose while parked, not covered by any existing charge.
The scan must be safe (no regen-while-driving false positives, no overlap with real
charges) and idempotent (re-running creates no duplicates).
