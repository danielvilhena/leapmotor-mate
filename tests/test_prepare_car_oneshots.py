"""#116 — a SPENT one-shot prepare-car appointment (no weekday + a start_time already in the past)
must be dropped from the full-state cmd-361 write, or the cloud -2-rejects the WHOLE batch and NO
schedule can be saved. Isolated on-car: recurring+past and one-shot+future both save fine; ONLY the
one-shot+past combination fails. These stale one-shots are inherited from the official app (schedules
live on the shared cloud), so Mate must filter them itself.

Skipped where leapmotor_api isn't installed (the CI env per pytest.ini); the drop logic is pure and
is exercised in-container / wherever the client is available."""
