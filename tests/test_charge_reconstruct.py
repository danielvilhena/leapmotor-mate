"""Regression tests for v1.13.x — GitHub #29: a charge that happens while the car is
asleep/offline to the cloud is never seen live (no plug/current ever polled), so the live
state machine never enters CHARGING and the session is lost. The recorder reconstructs it
from the SoC jump instead. These cover the DB row, the recorder's decision logic, and the
end-to-end seed-from-disk path (a charge during poller downtime)."""
